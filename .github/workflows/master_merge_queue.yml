# This workflow is a collection of workflows that are required for the merge queue.
#
# Many of the workflows that are jobs within this one, are able to be run on demand
# by issuing a comment with the respective command to trigger said workflow.
#
# The design of this workflow relies on the first real job "changes" to detect file
# changes against the base, and each downstream workflow after that will only be
# called if the files for that area have changed.

  # test jobs are not run. This allows us to not have to check for merge group in each test job.
